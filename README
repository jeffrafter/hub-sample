This is the start of a sample issue tracker with hub.js (http://github.com/hubjs/hub).

Most of this is based on the following gists, with code converted to the latest hub.js builds:

WebSocket: http://gist.github.com/358550
MemStore: http://gist.github.com/358547
Server: http://gist.github.com/358546
Demo: http://gist.github.com/358544

Currently this application requires a browser with an HTML5 WebSocket implementation
and local storage. On Mac OSX your best choice is WebKit.

Alternative non-HTML5 socket implementations
